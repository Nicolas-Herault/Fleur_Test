# Fleur_Test

##Â Introduction

This code base is meant to run a simple web server in a Kubernetes environment that communicate with a postgres database.
The kubernetes environment should have two namespace, each one with a pod.
One of this namespace (ns-storage) have a Docker image that can simply handle uuid and user and rely on a PersitentVolume.
The other namespace (ns-server) will run a python server with Flask to return the corrrect line of the table.

## Setup and deployment

We assume that we already have a Kubernetes cluster. If not, simply install minikube and use `minikube start`

To set the kubernetes environment, use this command: 
```
kubectl apply -f yml/setup.yaml -f yml/config_map.yaml -f yml/volumes.yaml -f yml/deployment.yaml -f yml/service.yaml
```

Then use `kubectl get all` to verify that all our resources are created and ready

To delete the resources if needed:
```
kubectl delete service postgres 
kubectl delete deployment postgres
kubectl delete configmap postgres-config
kubectl delete persistentvolumeclaim postgres-pv-claim
kubectl delete persistentvolume postgres-pv-volume
kubectl delete ns ns-server ns-storage
```
